# odin-landing-page

A landing page from the Odin Project - Flexbox

I loved the project, it allowed me to see how breaking down a task into smaller bits and dealing only with the bits step by steps allows you to make steady progress. HTML first then styling next. Deal with things section by section.

I was able to apply flexbox styling, use variables, import a font, see how css cascades, work with css combinators and experiment with the color-mix() function.
